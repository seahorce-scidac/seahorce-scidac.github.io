I was one of the Outreach Coordinators for the astronomy department at Berkeley. My main project was organizing [Astronomy Night](https://astro.berkeley.edu/news/events/astro-night/) at Berkeley. During the spring, summer, and fall, we have monthly public talks followed by a star party on the roof of Campbell Hall. The event brings 100+ visitors to the department every month.

Over the last few years, Science@Cal has started Spanish-language outreach programs in Oakland and San Francisco. I've led the astronomy department's involvement in these events.

I was part of a group of grad students who [raised](https://crowdfund.berkeley.edu/project/5941) over $7,000 to purchse virtual reality equipment to enhance our astronomy demos. I led the purchase and construction of our two desktop computer + Oculus Rift setups. We've gathered a range of VR demos that we show at events like Astro Night and Cal Day.
